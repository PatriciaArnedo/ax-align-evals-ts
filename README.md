# Mastra Agent with Arize AX Tracing

Companion repo for the [Arize AX tutorial](https://arize.com/docs/ax/). A Mastra orchestrator agent instrumented with OpenInference tracing that sends spans to Arize AX.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20.9.0+
- An [Arize AX](https://app.arize.com) account (Space ID and API key)
- An [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) API key

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export ARIZE_API_KEY="your-arize-api-key"
export ARIZE_SPACE_ID="your-arize-space-id"
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

This starts the Mastra dev server and opens the agent UI. Send requests to the weather orchestrator agent to generate traces — they will appear in your Arize AX space within a few seconds.

## How it works

A single orchestrator agent coordinates three tools in sequence:

```
User request
    ↓
Weather Orchestrator Agent
    ↓
weatherTool          → fetches current weather data
    ↓
weatherAnalysisTool  → analyzes weather patterns
    ↓
activityPlanningTool → recommends activities
    ↓
Final response
```

Tracing is configured in [src/mastra/index.ts](src/mastra/index.ts) using `@arizeai/openinference-mastra`. Every agent invocation and tool call is exported as an OpenInference span to `https://otlp.arize.com/v1/traces`.
